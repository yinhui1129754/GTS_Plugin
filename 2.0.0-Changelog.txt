======================================Balance
-Level difference with Targets (Spells): changed min and max spell efficiency from: [0.25 - 1.25] to [0.25 - 1.0]
 ^ Means spells no longer gain benefits if player/npc is higher level than the enemy, that's about it 
-Hit Growth: no longer capable of shrinking actors into nothing, a bit reduced shrink power
-Capped Vore attribute regen so it's not ridiculous if enemy has lots of hp for example
-Perks that add size-damage vunlerability to enemies: now capped at x3.0 damage boost

======================================Gameplay
-Size Matters skill tree now uses own perk points system, Player now gains own perk points for Size Matters skill tree instead of using and wasting global perk points 
-Player now also gains:
  - One perk point for each 5 GTS levels
  - Two bonus perk points for level 20 and 40
  - Three bonus perk points for level 60 and 80
  - Four bonus perk points for level 100 
  - To learn entire skill tree you must make the skill Legendary

-Crush Threshold is now increased by 2.5 times when you're not performing any size-related actions with the target. Threshold is same as before when you do them (Stomp and stuff).
-Footsteps now launch actors and objects without any perks by default. Radius is decreased and power is rebalanced. (if >x8 size difference)
-Rebalanced shrink rate, so bonuses no longer multiply themselves and just add flat value on top. Shrinking is less effective at max bonuses.
-Actors no longer insta-explode upon colliding with your feet when you're huge enough (Unless the damage is > than their health)
-Upon equipping Aspect Of Giantess for the first time, a tutorial message will pop up, explaining the enchantment.
-Collisions: if size difference between actors is > than x3.0, collisions between actors are going to be ignored.
-Thigh Sandwich always crushes actors regardless of size difference now (It had 8.0 size difference check)
-Rebalanced shrink spells: Made them consume x2 magicka, but also increased shrink rate by 100%
  ^ Decreased charge delay for high level spells and removed debuff stacks mechanic
  ^ As well as reduced shrink penalty on small targets, before: penalty = scale. Now: penalty = scale, with the cap of x0.5

-Dealing size-related damage now also adds size-related experience
-Decreased strong stomp default stamina consumption by ~25%
-Increased default feet-related size damage by 50%
-Random Growth now also works on followers

-Vore Perk: now removes stamina cost to perform vore entirely
-Reduced level requirements for some high-tier perks
-Perks that grant maximal size (lvl 10, 35): 
-^  Now add bonus size on top instead of overriding values, combining with quest progression naturally
